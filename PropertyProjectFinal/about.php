        <p>Hi, my name is victoria and I built this website as a hypothetical browsing platform for virtual real estate. I am a graduate student at Pratt Institute studying information experience design. I took this class to better understand the relationship and vocabulary between a UX Designer and a software engineer. Through building this website, I have learned a very valuable skill set to use in my career. Thanks for visiting this page!.</p>
